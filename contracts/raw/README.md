# Raw AssemblyScript smart contract examples

This folder contains three basic smart contract examples written in [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript).
They are mainly kept for reference and can be compiled independently of any other code in this repository.

AssemblyScript compiles a strict subset of TypeScript to WebAssembly using Binaryen.
