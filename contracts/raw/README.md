# Raw AssemblyScript smart contract examples

This folder contains three basic smart contract examples written in [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript).

The examples are the same as in the main `./contracts` folder and are mainly kept for reference. As stand-alone examples, they can be compiled independently of any other code in this repository.
